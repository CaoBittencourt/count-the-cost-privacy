Count the Cost is a free application intended to help users calculate and understand the financial costs of having a family. In order to do so, the app ships with a standard local, offline, database. The purpose of this database is twofold: 1) to store a user's information and display it in the application itself; 2) to perform mathematical estimations of expected family expenditure and to run similar economic models locally. Count the Cost does not share any of these data and does not have, or will have, any interest in doing so. It also makes no use of telemetry. And it will never violate its users' privacy in any way whatsover.
